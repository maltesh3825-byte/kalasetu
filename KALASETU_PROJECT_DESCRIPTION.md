## Idea Title

**KalaSetu: Voice-First Marketplace for Rural Artisans**

## Proposed Solution

KalaSetu is a mobile-first artisan marketplace that helps rural and marginalized artisans convert handmade products into professional digital listings using photographs and voice input.

An artisan can capture or upload a product image, describe the craft using voice or text, and receive an editable listing containing the product name, category, tags, English description, Hindi description, and suggested price range. The artisan reviews and approves the content before publishing it directly to the marketplace.

Customers can discover handmade products, save crafts, submit ratings and reviews without a mandatory purchase, contact artisans directly, and place orders.

## Core Workflow

1. **Sign in** - Select an artisan, seller, or buyer account.
2. **Capture** - Take a product photograph or select one from the gallery.
3. **Open the description module** - Use the voice-to-text control inside Artisan Studio.
4. **Speak product details** - Describe the materials, technique, cultural background, and intended use in Kannada or another supported language.
5. **Convert voice to text** - Speech recognition displays the live transcript directly in the product description field, where it can be corrected.
6. **Review catalog data** - Check the generated title, category, tags, and pricing guidance.
7. **Publish** - Publish the approved product with quantity and pricing details.
8. **Sell** - Customers discover products, review them, and submit orders.
9. **Manage** - Artisans manage listings, orders, and customer requests.

5. Publish directly
6. Receive and manage customer orders

The platform is designed for low-literacy, regional-language, and rural artisan communities.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- Marginalized and rural artisans
- Traditional craft workers
- Handloom and textile producers
- Pottery, metal, bamboo, and wood artisans

### Secondary Users

- Customers seeking authentic handmade products
- Retail buyers
- Institutional and bulk buyers
- Government and social-sector procurement teams

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend

- React Native
- Expo SDK
- TypeScript
- React Native Web for browser access

#### Mobile Capabilities

- Expo Image Picker for camera and gallery input
- Expo Speech for text-to-speech assistance
- Expo Speech Recognition for voice-to-text input
- AsyncStorage for offline drafts and local preferences

#### Artisan Studio Description Module

The Artisan Studio includes a dedicated description input module with a microphone control. The artisan can tap the voice-to-text button, speak product information, and see the recognized text appear directly in the description field. The transcript can be edited before it is sent with the product image to the cataloging service.

For Kannada input, speech recognition uses the `kn-IN` locale. The Kannada transcript is passed to the cataloging workflow, where the system interprets the notes and generates a natural English product title and description. Microphone and speech-recognition permissions are requested before recording begins.

#### Backend

- Python
- FastAPI
- REST APIs
- SQLite database
- Render deployment for the hosted backend API

#### Data and Storage

- SQLite for users, products, orders, reviews, and institutional requests
- Local mobile storage for offline catalog and bulk-request drafts
- Backend upload storage for product images

#### Integrations and Deployment

- Render for public FastAPI backend hosting
- Expo Application Services for Android preview and production builds
- WhatsApp direct-contact links
- REST-based authentication, product, order, review, and moderation APIs

> Implementation note: The current project uses React Native with Expo, FastAPI, SQLite, and Render. It does not currently use Flutter, Dart, or Firebase.

## Catalog Output

### Input

- Product photograph
- Artisan voice notes
- Live voice-to-text transcript from the Artisan Studio description module
- Artisan text notes
- Optional artisan price idea

### Output

- Product title
- Product category
- Searchable tags
- English product description
- Hindi product description
- Suggested fair-price range
- Pricing justification
- Craft heritage story
- Care instructions

## Human-in-the-Loop Design

Generated content is not published automatically. The artisan reviews, edits, and approves the listing before it becomes visible in the marketplace. This reduces the risk of incorrect product classification, inaccurate descriptions, and unsuitable pricing.

## Feasibility and Viability

### Technical Feasibility: High

React Native, Expo, FastAPI, SQLite, and Render are mature technologies. The application supports Android devices and browser-based access through React Native Web.

### Economic Feasibility: Medium-High

The system can begin with low infrastructure costs using SQLite and Render deployment. Storage and hosting costs can scale according to adoption.

### Operational Feasibility: High

The photo-first and voice-assisted workflow minimizes typing and reduces onboarding effort for artisans with limited digital experience.

### Market Feasibility: High

There is clear demand for authentic handmade products, online artisan discovery, and direct-to-customer commerce. Institutional and bulk procurement can further expand market opportunities.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Catalog inaccuracies | Human review and editing are required before publishing. |
| Low digital literacy | Guided steps, voice input, and language support reduce onboarding friction. |
| Limited connectivity | Offline catalog and bulk-request drafts with local device storage. |
| Language barriers | Multilingual interface and Kannada voice-to-text support with English catalog generation. |
| Trust and marketplace quality | Artisan profiles, product reviews, seller ownership controls and order tracking. |
| Backend or AI service unavailability | API error handling, local drafts and heuristic catalog fallback. |
